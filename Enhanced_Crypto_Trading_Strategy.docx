Enhanced Crypto Trading Bot Strategy Documentation

Executive Summary

This document outlines the complete enhanced trading strategy implemented in your crypto trading bot. The system combines RSI (Relative Strength Index), Turn Point Detection, Volume Confirmation, Trend Filtering, Take Profit, and Stop Loss mechanisms to create a professional-grade automated trading solution.

1. Strategy Overview

Core Components:
- RSI Analysis - Momentum indicator for overbought/oversold conditions
- Turn Point Detection - Identifies market peaks and troughs
- Volume Confirmation - Validates price movements with trading volume
- Trend Filter - Uses moving averages to identify market direction
- Take Profit - Automated profit-taking at predetermined levels
- Stop Loss - Risk management through automatic loss limitation

Signal Strength System:
The bot uses a 1-5 scale to rate signal quality:
- 5/5: Perfect - All conditions met
- 4/5: Strong - 3 conditions met
- 3/5: Good - 2 conditions met
- 2/5: Basic - 1 condition met
- 1/5: Simple - RSI only
